# Naming Convention
Our framework use the BEM-Convention to write readable classes. One of the best approach we think. **Take care that you don't interlace a lot.**

**Block**  
````scss
.c-button {}
````
**Element**
````scss
.c-button__element {}
````

**Modifier**  
````scss
.c-button--danger {}
````

### States
The principle has a lot of more ways how to write CSS, but Catwalk uses only two of that. The handling with states and ordering of properties in styling rule.

**States**  
We separate the normal styling rules from handling states like **`active`** or **`disabled`**. Please take care to put it in the end of the component.

````scss
.c-button {
  &.is-disabled {
    background-color: $color-gray;
  }
}
````
