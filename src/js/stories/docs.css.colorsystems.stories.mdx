# Color System
A system with four colors will help to scale up the architecture. There are different reasons to use colors. It would be possible to use it for the brand reprensation or you want to present a success message for the user. We have a lot of more use cases for the usage of colors.

**We categorize the colors into different groups:**
* Color Palette
* Brand Colors
* Layout Colors
* Semantic Colors

## Color Palette
It contains all colors from the project. Each other color variable is based on this palette.

$color-red-base: #ff0000;
