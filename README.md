## Helpful Commands

When working in Frontastic Catwalk, the following shell commands are quite
helpful. Please make sure to execute them in your VM:

- `$ ant -p` tells you which build commands are available, like executing
  tests, checking the code style, etc.
- In any project directory or in `paas/catwalk/`: `$ bin/console` is the Symfony
  Console that supports many Frontastic related commands and can perform
  general tasks like purging the cache.
- Using `$ sudo supervisorctl status` displays the status of all supervisor
  jobs, e.g. webpack. `supervisorctl` can also start/stop/restart these jobs.
- If you want to peak at the Catwalk databases use `$ mysql -u root -proot` in
  the VM
